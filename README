Agim is a program to select MTA and its configuration for outgoing mail in
dependence on the network to which is the computer currently connected. Hence,
it is designed primary for laptops or other mobile computers roaming across
networks with different e-mail related restrictions and policies.


To use agim, set is as MTA to use in your mail user agent and set up its
configuration file (~/.agimrc) in the following format:

<test-command> {
	...
	<command>
}

...

where the block in the curly braces is executed only when the <test-command>
returns true, otherwise it is skipped. Inside or after this block may be other
command or blocks of commands.


USAGE
	agim [-C config-file] [MTA arguments ...]



SUPPORTED COMMANDS


Testing:

net address[/mask]

	Address is IPv4 or IPv6 address or domain name. The command returns
	true if any of the network interfaces of this computer has this address
	assigned.

	Optional parameter mask specifies the number of bits of address that
	are actually compared, effectively testing membership in given IP
	network. Note that only mask length is supported, mask can not be given
	in the dotted quad notation even if the address is IPv4.

essid name

	Returns true if any of the wireless interfaces has the ESSID equal to
	name.

true
	Returns true.

false
	Returns false.

any
	Returns true if any of the commands since last curly-braced block
	returned true, otherwise false.

all
	Returns true if all of the commands since last curly-braced block
	returned true, otherwise false.


Delivery:

send program [arguments ...]

	Relays the mail to the MTA program with specified parameters.
	Additionally, arguments specified to the agim (except -C and its
	parameter if it is the first command-line argument) are appended to the
	list of arguments of newly executed program.

	After executing this command, the mail is passed to the external
	program and no further actions are performed by agim.


Other:

copy
	Makes a copy of the message, for one copy, the agim behaves as if the
	copy returned true, for the other as if it returned false. In effect,
	the mail is delivered once by the rules in following sub-block and once
	for the rules after it.



ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

	Expansion of environmental variables is supported with the syntax of
	$VARNAME or ${VARNAME} anywhere where the command names or their
	arguments are given.



QUOTING AND ESCAPING
	
	Shell-like syntax is supported for escaping (using backslash) or
	quoting (using single or double quotes) of white space or special
	characters ({, }, $, #, \, ', "). Single quotes suppresses variable
	expansion along with special meaning of any character till matching
	quote.
	


COMMENTS

	Unescaped hash sign (#) with all characters until the first newline are
	considered comment and not evaluated.
